          <img src="images/1.svg" /> Why do I need an attorney when I have been
          in an accident?
        </h3>
        <p>
          No one, not even an attorney, should represent themselves in an
          insurance claim or legal matter. Our office deals with insurance
          companies daily, we have handled thousands of cases just like yours,
          we know how to set up the claims, apply for all types of coverage's,
          take care of complex legal issues and make sure that the client
          receives the maximum dollar amount for their injuries and damages.
        </p>

      <div class="qna">
        <h3><img src="images/2.svg" /> What do I do at the accident scene?</h3>
        <p>
          You should call the police if necessary, get the names of all parties
          and witnesses, get all the insurance information, take photos, and
          attend to all injured persons. Never admit fault at the scene of the
          accident. Always cooperate with the law enforcement. Take down all of
          the information on the parties, their insurance and the cars involved.
          Immediately call our office so we can help you.

        <h3>
          <img src="images/3.svg" /> Can you come to my home or office after the
          accident?
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of my managers will immediately come to your home or office to get
          you signed up and begin handling your case. We will refer you to a
          doctor if you don't have one to take care of your injuries.

      <div class="qna">
        <h3><img src="images/4.svg" /> Is your office fluent in Spanish?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, my office staff is fluent in Spanish. We have successfully
          handled hundreds of Spanish speaking clients.

        <h3>
          <img src="images/5.svg" /> What are the charges for your services?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We never charge our clients any money upfront. We handle personal
          injury cases on a contingency basis. That is, we only get paid a fee
          of one third of the total settlement when we win your case for you. If
          there is no recovery, you aren't required to pay my firm any money. We
          do charge at the end of the case some small amount for the costs
          involved but again only if we win your case for you.

        <h3>
          <img src="images/6.svg" /> Why should I choose your firm instead of
          another law firm?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have been handling personal injury auto accident cases in Southern
          California for over 45 years. I have tried numerous Superior Court
          jury trials. For many years I represented the insurance companies, so
          I know what they are going to do in advance. We are experts in the
          area of coverage issues in regard to auto cases. My staff has many
          years of experience in assisting clients on such cases. I personally
          negotiate each settlement to its conclusion for the client. No other
          attorney will be more vigorous in negotiating a client's settlement. I
          have the highest rating for quality of work and legal ethics as rated
          by Martindale Legal Publications.

          <img src="images/7.svg" /> Do you handle cases outside the Los Angeles
          area?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes, we have represented clients from Sacramento to San Diego and from
          Catalina Island to Palm Springs.

        <h3>
          <img src="images/8.svg" /> Many attorneys don't return calls. How do I
          get hold of you?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My office is open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on normal business days, If
          you call after-hours, you can leave a voice mail or call my cell
          phone, which is noted on the voice mail and on my "Contact" page. My
          staff returns all calls before they go home. After hours we are always
          available to return calls by our cell phones. My clients can always
          reach me even on the weekends.
